## Overview
The Support Vector Boosting Machine (SVBM) is a machine learning framework designed to enhance classification performance by integrating principles from AdaBoost and residual connections. This hybrid approach strengthens the classification capabilities of traditional Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

The provided source code implements a subsampled SVM model with an RBF kernel as the base classifier. For users looking to further improve the model's sparsity and overall performance, the linearly programmed SVM (LPSVM) approach is recommended. The SVBM can also be combined with various optimization algorithms for further enhancements.
