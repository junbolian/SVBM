## Introduction

Welcome to the Support Vector Boosting Machine (SVBM) repository! This repository contains the source code for the SVBM model, a machine learning framework that combines AdaBoost principles and residual connections to enhance the performance of traditional Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Detailed documentation and examples are provided to help users effectively apply the SVBM model in their projects.

## Overview

The SVBM model is detailed in the paper titled *"Support Vector Boosting Machine (SVBM): Enhancing Classification Performance with AdaBoost and Residual Connections"* by Junbo Lian. The model uses an RBF kernel and supports further enhancements such as linearly programmed SVM (LPSVM) for increased sparsity and performance. It can also be integrated with optimization algorithms to improve results.

### Key Features
1. **Subsampled SVM with RBF Kernel**: Implements an SVM with an RBF kernel for robust classification.
2. **Linearly Programmed SVM (LPSVM)**: Optional approach for improved sparsity and efficiency.
3. **Integration with Optimization Algorithms**: Enhances performance through algorithmic optimizations.
4. **Residual Connections**: Aids in improving model accuracy by mitigating overfitting.
5. **Modular Design**: Easy to adapt and expand for different research and practical applications.

### Parameter Inputs:
- `X`: Input data matrix.
- `y`: Corresponding labels.
- `kernel`: Type of kernel (e.g., 'RBF').
- `parameters`: Customizable SVM parameters.

### Installation
Clone the repository and ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/junbolian/SVBM.git
cd SVBM
```

### Usage Example:
```matlab
% Load your data into variables X and y
model = SVBM(X, y, 'RBF', parameters);
[accuracy, predictions] = model.trainAndTest();
```
